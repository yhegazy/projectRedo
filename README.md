- Step 3. Create a new branch. it will be used to push your changes
- Step 4. Update ReadMe.md file by adding the following at the end of this text:
  `DD/MM/YYYY-discordName-ST was here!`
- Step 4b. Change DD/MM/YYYY-discordName-ST with the date and your discord name  (This should go without saying, so take this as your warning.)
