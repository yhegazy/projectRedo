The best way to do anything is to - do. Don't be of those who talk a big talk, but don't walk the big walk.

Allah swt says in the Qur'an:
"Oh you have believed, why do you say what you do not do" Q61:2

Learning a programming language, library or framework is like learning a human language. you need to have "the know how" when it comes to vocabulary, grammar, punctuation and structure. The only way to know this is through repetitiveness

The goal is simple. It is to "Git Gud". Repeat the process until you own it. Today's task is simple - learn reactjs. Although reactjs is complicated in nature, as programmers, we need to have "the know how" when breaking down code into smaller tasks and easily biteable functions of code.

If you know React, then you know Preact, nanoJSX, and React Native. Simple. Easy.

We will be using Vite to help build this project. 

JSX is JS XML. There are other libraries and frameworks that are similar in nature with JSX such as EtaJS and EJS for example. EJS stands for Embedded JavaScript. It is the templating tool for NodeJS.

JSX gives us the ability to write HTML inside it.
